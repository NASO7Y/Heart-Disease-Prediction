# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease from a dataset (heart_disease.csv). The data was preprocessed with label encoding, imputation, and SMOTE for class balancing. Models like SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree were applied and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
